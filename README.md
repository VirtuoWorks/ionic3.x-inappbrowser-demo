# ionic3.x-inappbrowser-demo

This demo is a testbed for Cordova's *[cordova-plugin-inappbrowser](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/in-app-browser/)* plugin and Ionic Native's corresponding *[In App Browser](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/in-app-browser/)* plugin.

## Features
All the options exposed by Ionic Native's *[In App Browser](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/in-app-browser/)* plugin for each platform are easily configurable via a settings menu.

The **Events** page allows to observe the events fired by the plugin (more to come).

## How to use

* Clone the repo and install the dependencies with npm.
* Run the project on a device or emulator
